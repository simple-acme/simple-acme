The difference between these two is that the installation plugin can be configured separately for each renewal and has access to a lot more context about the new and previous certificates. Also when the installation script fails, the renewal will be retried later. That is not the case for the pre/post execution scripts. Any errors there are logged but otherwise ignored.",
